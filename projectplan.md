# CI/CD Playground Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create an interactive "CI/CD Playground" where users can click a button to commit a change and watch GitHub Actions run in real-time through a web UI.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js dashboard with "Run Pipeline" button
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API for GitHub integration
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers deployed on GCP Cloud Run
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with live log streaming via WebSockets

## Security Group Reference
- Use sg-01c9d9f9004c3949a (Open_SecurityGroup)

## GitHub Repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/csantosscott/ci-cd-playground
- **Type**: Public repository for demo purposes

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize project structure with frontend and backend directories
- [x] Create package.json files for both frontend and backend
- [x] Set up basic folder structure and configuration files
- [x] Initialize Git repository if needed
- [x] Create GitHub remote repository

### Phase 2: Backend API Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Express server with basic routing
- [x] Implement GitHub API integration (using GitHub App or PAT)
- [x] Add endpoint to create commits via GitHub REST API
- [x] Add endpoint to fetch GitHub Actions workflow runs
- [x] Implement WebSocket server for live log streaming
- [x] Add GitHub Actions API polling functionality

### Phase 3: Frontend Dashboard Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Next.js app with basic routing
- [x] Build main dashboard component with "Run Pipeline" button
- [x] Implement WebSocket client for live log updates
- [x] Create log display component with real-time updates
- [x] Add GitHub Actions status badges and indicators
- [x] Style the UI for professional appearance

### Phase 4: Docker Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create multi-stage Dockerfile for frontend (Node build → Nginx serve)
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend (Node.js Alpine)
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [x] Test local container builds and networking
- [x] Test manually by spinning up the application locally

### Phase 5: GitHub Actions Workflow ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create sample Node.js project for CI/CD testing
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow with linting and testing
- [x] Configure workflow to output detailed logs
- [x] Add workflow status reporting back to the application

### Phase 6: GCP Cloud Run Deployment ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up GCP project and enable Cloud Run API
- [x] Create service account with necessary permissions
- [x] Deploy backend to Cloud Run with proper error handling
- [x] Deploy frontend to Cloud Run with production URLs
- [x] Configure environment variables for frontend build process
- [x] Fix Docker build configuration for static Next.js deployment

### Phase 7: Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test end-to-end workflow: WebSocket connection and API calls
- [x] Verify WebSocket connections work in production
- [x] Test error handling for missing GitHub credentials
- [x] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
- [x] Fix frontend-backend URL configuration issues

### Phase 8: Security and Secret Management ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement GCP Secret Manager for GitHub App credentials
- [x] Store all sensitive GitHub data in Secret Manager
- [x] Update backend to load secrets from Secret Manager with fallback
- [x] Deploy backend with proper IAM permissions for Secret Manager
- [x] Fix GitHub App ID and Installation ID in Secret Manager
- [x] Verify GitHub App authentication working successfully

### Phase 9: Documentation and Polish
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
- [ ] Add environment variable documentation
- [ ] Create demo GIF showing the full workflow
- [x] Test the public demo URL functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Dependencies
- Next.js
- React
- WebSocket client library
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js
- @octokit/rest (GitHub API client)
- ws (WebSocket server)
- cors
- dotenv

### Environment Variables Needed
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_APP_*` credentials
- `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER`
- `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
- `GCP_REGION`

## Deployment Strategy
1. Build Docker images locally for testing
2. Set up GCP Cloud Run services
3. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
4. Deploy with automatic scaling and HTTPS

## Success Criteria
- [x] Deployment works on GCP Cloud Run
- [x] Public demo URL accessible to clients
- [x] Frontend-backend integration working via WebSocket
- [x] Proper error handling when GitHub credentials not configured
- [x] Users can click one button to trigger a commit (GitHub App setup complete)
- [x] GitHub Actions automatically start after commit (GitHub App setup complete)
- [x] Live logs stream in real-time to the web UI (GitHub App setup complete)
- [ ] Complete documentation for self-hosting

## Review Section

### Changes Made
- **Successfully deployed both frontend and backend to GCP Cloud Run**
- **Implemented robust WebSocket connection between frontend and backend**
- **Added comprehensive error handling for missing GitHub App credentials**
- **Fixed Docker build process for Next.js static export with production URLs**
- **Added detailed logging with emojis for better debugging visibility**
- **Implemented graceful degradation when GitHub features are unavailable**
- **Integrated GCP Secret Manager for secure credential storage**
- **Fixed GitHub App authentication with correct App ID and Installation ID**
- **Achieved full end-to-end CI/CD pipeline functionality**

### Key Learnings
- **Next.js Static Export Challenges**: Environment variables must be set at build time, not runtime, when using `output: 'export'`
- **Cloud Run WebSocket Support**: WebSockets work perfectly on Cloud Run with proper configuration
- **Docker Multi-stage Builds**: Required careful handling of environment variables between build and runtime stages
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Better to have services start successfully with limited functionality than crash completely
- **Logging Strategy**: Detailed logging with visual indicators (emojis) significantly improves debugging in cloud environments
